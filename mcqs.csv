What is the likely diagnosis, and which gland is primarily affected?","A) Pheochromocytoma, adrenal gland","B) Hyperthyroidism, thyroid gland","C) Diabetes insipidus, pituitary gland","D) SIADH, pituitary gland",B,"Positive anti-TSH receptor antibodies suggest Graves' disease, a form of hyperthyroidism, leading to excessive thyroid hormone production and catabolic symptoms."
MCQ on Scenario Based,"4. A 45-year-old woman post-thyroidectomy reports muscle cramps, tingling in her fingers, and facial twitching. Labs show low serum calcium, high phosphorus, and low PTH levels.

What is the likely diagnosis, and which gland is primarily affected?","A) Hypoparathyroidism, parathyroid glands","B) Hyperthyroidism, thyroid gland","C) Diabetes mellitus, pancreas","D) Pheochromocytoma, adrenal glands",A," Idiopathic or autoimmune hypoparathyroidism causes deficient PTH, disrupting calcium homeostasis and leading to neuromuscular irritability and cardiac issues."
MCQ on Scenario Based,"6. A 60-year-old woman complains of bone pain, kidney stones, and constipation. Labs show hypercalcemia, low phosphorus, and elevated PTH levels. What is the likely diagnosis, and which gland is primarily affected?","A) Hypoparathyroidism, parathyroid glands","B) Hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid glands","C) Addison’s disease, adrenal glands","D) Diabetes insipidus, pituitary gland",B," Primary hyperparathyroidism (e.g., adenoma) causes excessive PTH, leading to hypercalcemia and the "stones, bones, groans" triad (kidney stones, bone pain, abdominal issues)."
MCQ on Scenario Based,"7. A 55-year-old man presents with depression, fatigue, and recurrent fractures. Imaging reveals parathyroid adenoma, and labs confirm high calcium and PTH. What is the likely diagnosis, and which gland is primarily affected?","A) Cushing’s syndrome, adrenal glands","B) Hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid glands","C) SIADH, pituitary gland","D) Hypothyroidism, thyroid gland",B,"Excess PTH from an adenoma mobilizes calcium from bones, causing osteoporosis (fractures) and neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression."
